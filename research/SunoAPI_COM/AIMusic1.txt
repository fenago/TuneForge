# Credits Usage Guide

# AI Music API Credits Usage Guide

Our credit system is unified across all supported models, ensuring a seamless experience for managing your usage. Below is a detailed explanation of how credits work:

## 1. Unified Credit System
Credits are universally applicable for music generation with the **Suno**, **Riffusion**, and **Nuro** models. Each API call consumes credits based on the type of service you are using.

## 2. Extra Credits
If your monthly subscription credits run out, you can purchase extra credits as needed. We provide a purchase-by-volume feature: 0.08$ / 10 credits.

- **Purchase Extra Credits**: Visit our [extra credits purchase page](https://sunoapi.com/dashboard/usage).  
- **Usage**: Extra credits are consumed **before** your subscription credits and **do not expire**, offering flexible usage.  
- **Requirement**: You must have an active subscription to use extra credits.

## 3. Monthly Subscription Credits
Your monthly subscription credits reset at the start of each billing cycle. **Unused credits do not carry over** to the next cycle.

## 4. Credit Consumption Rules
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the credits required per API call:

### Suno 
- **All models**: 10 credits per API call 
  - Each API call generates **2 songs**.

### Riffusion 
- **All models**: 10 credits per API call 
  - Each API call generates **2 songs**.
