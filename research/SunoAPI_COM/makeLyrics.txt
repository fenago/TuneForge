                    lyrics: |-
                      [Verse]
                      In the alley dark as night
                      Lonely whispers out of sight
                      I hear footsteps cold and tight
                      Echoes of a fearsome fright

                      [Verse 2]
                      Candles flicker in the rain
                      Shadows dance they feel my pain
                      Hollow hearts and silent chains
                      In this void we all remain

                      [Chorus]
                      Screaming in the silence deep
                      Monsters in my tangled sleep
                      In the dark where secrets creep
                      Promises we couldn't keep

                      [Verse 3]
                      Windows shattered whisper slow
                      Broken dreams that never show
                      Faces lost in undertow
                      Memories of what we know

                      [Bridge]
                      Hands that reach but never find
                      Hope is just a state of mind
                      In the night the stars aligned
                      But they left our souls behind

                      [Chorus]
                      Screaming in the silence deep
                      Monsters in my tangled sleep
                      In the dark where secrets creep
                      Promises we couldn't keep
                  - title: Midnight Shadows
                    lyrics: |-
                      [Verse]
                      Midnight shadows creeping up the wall
                      Voices whisper secrets in the hall
                      Darkness paints the sky with shades of fear
                      Haunting echoes say the end is near

                      [Verse 2]
                      Broken mirrors shards scattered on the floor
                      Ghostly figures dance through every door
                      Candlelight flickers casting twisted dreams
                      Nightmare visions tearing at the seams

                      [Chorus]
                      We’re lost in the midnight maze alone
                      Trapped by whispers cold as stone
                      Shadows wrap tight like a silent curse
                      In this blackened void it only gets worse

                      [Verse 3]
                      Falling deeper shadows swallow hope
                      In their endless grip we can’t cope
                      Heartbeats racing drums in the dark
                      No escape just chasing dying sparks

                      [Bridge]
                      Shattered souls calling from the abyss
                      Lost in time where nightmares kiss
                      Darkness binds in its cruel embrace
                      No more light in this desolate place

                      [Chorus]
                      We’re lost in the midnight maze alone
                      Trapped by whispers cold as stone
                      Shadows wrap tight like a silent curse
                      In this blackened void it only gets worse
