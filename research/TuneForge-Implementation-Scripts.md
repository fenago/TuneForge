## **ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 0: CRITICAL FOUNDATION**

### **Script 0: Unified Metadata Tracking System (START HERE)**

```
PROMPT FOR WINDSURF:

CRITICAL: We need to unify our metadata tracking system to handle both SunoAPI.com and SunoAPI.org responses consistently. Currently our system may not be capturing all metadata properly from both APIs.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Standardize metadata collection from BOTH APIs
2. Create unified Song schema that captures all possible fields
3. Map different API response formats to consistent internal structure
4. Ensure no data loss regardless of which API is used

UNIFIED SONG METADATA SCHEMA:
```typescript
interface UnifiedSongMetadata {
  // Core identification
  id: string;
  title: string;
  user_id: string;
  created_at: Date;
  
  // API tracking
  api_provider: 'sunoapi_com' | 'sunoapi_org';
  api_task_id: string;
  api_clip_id?: string;
  
  // Generation details
  prompt: string;
  tags: string;
  lyrics: string;
  is_instrumental: boolean;
  
  // Technical details
  model_version: string;
  duration: number;
  audio_url: string;
  image_url?: string;
  video_url?: string;
  
  // Audio analysis (from either API)
  tempo?: number;
  key?: string;
  energy_level?: number;
  mood?: string;
  
  // Processing status
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  processing_time?: number;
  
  // Advanced features
  persona_id?: string;
  parent_song_id?: string; // For extensions/variations
  is_variation: boolean;
  variation_type?: 'extend' | 'cover' | 'remix' | 'stems';
  
  // File management
  file_formats: string[]; // ['mp3', 'wav', etc.]
  file_sizes: Record<string, number>;
  download_count: number;
  
  // Quality metrics
  generation_cost: number;
  user_rating?: number;
  is_featured: boolean;
}
```

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
1. Update database schema to include all metadata fields
2. Create API response mapping functions for both providers
3. Update all song creation/update functions to use unified schema
4. Add migration script for existing songs
5. Create validation functions for metadata completeness
6. Add logging for metadata extraction process
7. Update admin dashboard to show metadata coverage

API RESPONSE MAPPING:
- Map SunoAPI.com response format to unified schema
- Map SunoAPI.org response format to unified schema  
- Handle missing fields gracefully with defaults
- Validate required fields are present
- Log any mapping errors for debugging

KEEP IT SIMPLE:
- One Song model/interface for everything
- Clear mapping functions: mapSunoComResponse() and mapSunoOrgResponse()
- Consistent field names regardless of source API
- Automatic fallbacks for missing data

This is CRITICAL foundation work - do this first before any other features.

## **ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1: FOUNDATION**

### **Script 1: Dual-Mode Interface Implementation**

```
PROMPT FOR WINDSURF:

Implement a simplified dual-mode interface for TuneForge with clear separation between casual and power users.

SURPRISE ME MODE (Casual Users):
- Single text input: "Describe your musical vision..."
- Three quick-start buttons: "Chill Vibes", "Energetic Anthem", "Emotional Ballad"
- One big "Create My Song" button
- Smart defaults: Chirp v4, AI-decides gender, appropriate tags from description
- Show which API will be used (visual indicator)
- Progress indicator with estimated time

ADVANCED MODE (Power Users):
- Current full interface with all controls
- Tabbed sections: Concept | Style | Technical | Upload
- All current features: title, concept, lyrics, style, model, etc.
- Clear API selection with explanations:
  * "Use SunoAPI.com for: Advanced personas, stem separation, extensions"
  * "Use SunoAPI.org for: Lyrics generation, videos, streaming preview"

KEEP IT SIMPLE:
1. Big toggle switch at top: [Surprise Me] | [Advanced]
2. Conditional rendering based on mode
3. Smart API selection (don't overwhelm users with choice)
4. Clear visual feedback about what's happening
5. Mobile-responsive design

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Create mode toggle component
2. Simplify Surprise Me interface 
3. Reorganize Advanced mode into clear sections
4. Add smart defaults engine
5. Visual API indicators throughout
6. Loading states with clear feedback

Make it beautiful, intuitive, and fast. Users should never be confused about what's happening.
```

### **Script 2: Simplified API Provider System**

```
PROMPT FOR WINDSURF:

Create a simple, clear system for showing users which API is being used without overwhelming them.

VISUAL INDICATORS (Keep Simple):
- Small badge on generated songs: "ðŸŸ¢ Advanced" (for .com) or "ðŸŸ£ Creative" (for .org)
- During generation: "Generating with Advanced AI..." or "Generating with Creative AI..."
- In song details: Clear provider indicator with capabilities

USER-FRIENDLY NAMING:
- Don't use technical names like "SunoAPI.com" - confusing for users
- SunoAPI.com = "Advanced AI" (green) - for professional features
- SunoAPI.org = "Creative AI" (purple) - for creative features

LOGGING (Backend Only):
- Log every API call with full technical details
- Track: provider, endpoint, response time, cost, success/failure
- Store in database for analytics
- Admin dashboard shows technical details

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Create simple APIProviderBadge component
2. Update all song displays with clear, simple badges
3. Add provider tracking to database (technical field)
4. Create admin-only technical dashboard
5. Keep user-facing language simple and clear

RULE: Users see simple, friendly names. Admins see technical details. Never confuse users with technical API names.


in the /docs folder - we need a phase 1 complete file as markdown.  this file should include all files created, all dependencies added, and all environment variables set.  it should also include test scripts and manual testing instructions.  See this for an example:  C:\WindsurfProjects\TuneForge\fenago21\docs\PHASE-0-COMPLETE.md
